# EHRoes ðŸ¦¸: an all-in-one web application for patientsâ€™ data digitization and exploration

**EHRoes** is developped for my thesis within the **MYO-xIA project**.
It features a standard vocabulary creator, optical character recognition (OCR), natural language processing (NLP), image annotation and segmentation using machine learning, interactive visualizations and automatic diagnosis prediction.

## Demo Usage Instructions

If you are on the demo instance (https://ehroes.lbgi.fr), you can login on top right with **login: demo ; password: demo**
The application is preloaded with a database of histology reports and a standard vocabulary for muscle biopsy. Data on this demo instance is reset once every day.
For the PDF automatic analysis, you can find a sample PDF [HERE](https://www.lbgi.fr/~meyer/EHRoes/sample_demo_report.pdf) working with the preinstalled standard vocabulary. A sample image for image annotation can be found [HERE](https://www.lbgi.fr/~meyer/EHRoes/sample_image_histo.jpg).
## Partners
EHRoes is developped and used in collaboration with the [Morphological Unit of the Institute of Myology of Paris](https://www.institut-myologie.org/en/recherche-2/neuromuscular-exploration-and-evaluation-centre/laboratoire-dhistopathologie-dr-norma-b-romero/). A production instance is deployed to help discovering new relevant features for congenital myopathies classification and diagnosis.

## EHRoes Abstract

**Background**
With a growing amount of patient data such as sequencing, imaging, and medical records, electronic health records (EHR) are now central to drive research and improve diagnosis of patients by using multimodal data. Exploiting patient data is a challenge as patient data exploitation tools ecosystem is often fragmented into tools to digitize and format the data and those interpreting the data (exploration, diagnosis). Furthermore, as most of the tools are specialized in one type of data, a multitude of software is needed for multimodal approaches. There is a strong need for a simple, all-rounder and flexible platform.
**Results**
In this paper we present EHRoes, an all-in-one web application to digitize and explore patient data. EHRoes has a module-based architecture, composed of four modules to: (i) create a standard vocabulary for a domain (ii) automatically digitize free-text data to a set of standard terms (iii) annotate images with standard vocabulary using automatic segmentation and (iv) generate an automatic visualization dashboard to provide insight on the data and perform automatic diagnosis suggestions. We demonstrated the utility of EHRoes by digitizing 40 artificial muscle histology reports of patients with congenital myopathies.
**Conclusions**
With EHRoes we created a platform for both digitization and exploration of patient data that can handle image data and free-text data. As it uses user-designed standard vocabulary, it is highly flexible to fit any domain of research. It can be used both as a patient registry with automatic diagnosis or as a research tool to explore a cohort of patients. A demo instance of the application is available at https://ehroes.lbgi.fr.

## MYO-xIA Project

The MYO-xIA project aims to collect data from patients with **congenital myopathies** in order to analyse them using **explainable AI approaches**. In the field of congenital myopathies research, there is an important need for **digitization and standardization of patient data** in order to use modern data analysis methods.
This project has tree mains objectives:

- **Gather and format patient data** to be ready for automatic exploitation (patient histology-report form, image annotation, OCR/NLP)
- Help the **discovery of new phenotype-genotype-histology** association for each congenital myopathy subtype (standard vocabulary creation tool, per gene and per class histology feature statistics)
- Provide tools for **automatic diagnosis** based on patient data (live prediction of congenital myopathy subtype with histology reports, images, genetic data and phenotype)
