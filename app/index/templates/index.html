    <strong>EHRoes</strong> is developped for my thesis within the
    <strong>MYO-xIA project</strong>.<br />It features a standard vocabulary
    creator, optical character recognition (OCR), natural language processing
    (NLP), image annotation and segmentation using machine learning, interactive
    visualizations and automatic diagnosis prediction.

  <h2>Demo Usage Instructions</h2>
  <p align="justify">
    If you are on the demo instance (<a href="https://ehroes.lbgi.fr">https://ehroes.lbgi.fr</a>), you can login on top
    right with
    <strong>login: demo ; password: demo</strong><br /> The application is
    preloaded with a database of histology reports and a standard vocabulary for
    muscle biopsy. Data on this demo instance is reset once every day.<br />
    For the PDF automatic analysis, you can find a sample PDF
    <a href="https://www.lbgi.fr/~meyer/EHRoes/sample_demo_report.pdf">HERE</a>
    working with the preinstalled standard vocabulary. A sample image for image
    annotation can be found

  <h2>EHRoes Abstract</h2>
  <p align="justify">
    <strong>Background</strong><br />With a growing amount of patient data such as sequencing, imaging, and medical
    records, electronic health records (EHR) are now central to drive research and improve diagnosis of patients by
    using multimodal data. Exploiting patient data is a challenge as patient data exploitation tools ecosystem is often
    fragmented into tools to digitize and format the data and those interpreting the data (exploration, diagnosis).
    Furthermore, as most of the tools are specialized in one type of data, a multitude of software is needed for
    multimodal approaches. There is a strong need for a simple, all-rounder and flexible platform.
    <br />
    <strong>Results</strong>
    <br />
    In this paper we present EHRoes, an all-in-one web application to digitize and explore patient data. EHRoes has a
    module-based architecture, composed of four modules to: (i) create a standard vocabulary for a domain (ii)
    automatically digitize free-text data to a set of standard terms (iii) annotate images with standard vocabulary
    using automatic segmentation and (iv) generate an automatic visualization dashboard to provide insight on the data
    and perform automatic diagnosis suggestions. We demonstrated the utility of EHRoes by digitizing 40 artificial
    muscle histology reports of patients with congenital myopathies.
    <br />
    <strong>Conclusions</strong>
    <br />
    With EHRoes we created a platform for both digitization and exploration of patient data that can handle image data
    and free-text data. As it uses user-designed standard vocabulary, it is highly flexible to fit any domain of
    research. It can be used both as a patient registry with automatic diagnosis or as a research tool to explore a
    cohort of patients. A demo instance of the application is available at <a
      href="https://ehroes.lbgi.fr">https://ehroes.lbgi.fr</a>.

  <h2>MYO-xIA Project</h2>
  <p align="justify">
    The MYO-xIA project aims to collect data from patients with
    <strong>congenital myopathies</strong> in order to analyse them using
    <strong>explainable AI approaches</strong>. In the field of congenital
    myopathies research, there is an important need for
    <strong>digitization and standardization of patient data</strong> in order
    to use modern data analysis methods.<br />This project has tree mains
    objectives:
  </p>
  <ul align="justify">
    <li>
      <strong>Gather and format patient data</strong> to be ready for automatic
      exploitation (patient histology-report form, image annotation, OCR/NLP)
    </li>
    <li>
      Help the
      <strong>discovery of new phenotype-genotype-histology</strong> association
      for each congenital myopathy subtype (standard vocabulary creation tool,
      per gene and per class histology feature statistics)
    </li>
    <li>
      Provide tools for <strong>automatic diagnosis</strong> based on patient
      data (live prediction of congenital myopathy subtype with histology
      reports, images, genetic data and phenotype)
    </li>
  </ul>
